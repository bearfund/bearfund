# BEAR Fund

Bear Fund is an Ethereum Venture Capitalist Organization comprised of up to 1,000 founding members. The strategy is focused on the 4 year cycle in cryptocurrency based on the Bitcoin halvings. Our philosophy & that of our founders are that "Fortunes are made in the Bear Market."

## Investment Thesis

The GP & CEO, Drew Roberts, believes that all of Web3 (cryptocurrency) currently trades along the 4-year Bitcoin cycle. This includes a 1 - 1.5 year Bull Run followed by 2 years of drastic pullback in the Bear Market and a 6 month bottoming out until the next $BTC halving.

Our founders believe that Sovereign Individuals should invest in Bitcoin individually in cold storage wallets as the best mechanism of a store of value. They should also diversify into Ethereum that has the best market share for smart contracts and other transactions. At the end of the Bull Run each cycle, they should "stable coin out" profits and invest in other real world assets like land to be in the best position for the bottoming out of the Bear Market.

Diversity is key for success in this new world post -crypto. Our portfolio construction will include:

- 50% Blue Chip NFTs (Crypto Punks, BAYC, etc.)
- 25% Meme Coins & DAO tokens
- 25% Proprietary Projects that will be airdropped to founders
